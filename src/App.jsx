          Due to a high volume of work and ongoing university exams, I am
          currently unable to complete the assignment. Several intensive
          projects are underway, and balancing both work and exams has created a
          significant workload. I am hopeful to complete it soon once these
          projects and exams conclude.

          Thank you for your understanding and patience.
